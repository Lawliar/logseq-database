\subsection{Implementation}
\label{inclusion:sec:implementation}

In this section, we discuss our prototype implementation of \excision for
detecting and blocking malicious third-party content inclusions. We implemented
\excision as a set of modifications to the Chromium browser\footnote{While our
implementation could be adopted as-is by any browser vendors that use
WebKit-derived engines, the design presented here is highly likely to be
portable to other browsers.}. In order to implement our system, we needed to
modify Blink and the Chromium extension engine to enable \excision to detect and
block inclusions of malicious content in an online and automatic fashion while
the web page is loading. The entire set of modifications consists of less than
1,000 lines of C++ and several lines of JavaScript.

\subsubsection{Enhancements to the Blink}

Blink is primarily responsible for parsing HTML documents, managing script
execution, and fetching resources from the network. Consequently, it is ideally
suited for constructing the inclusion tree for a web page, as well as blocking
the inclusion of malicious content.

\subsubsection{Enhancements to the Extension Engine}

The Chromium extension engine handles the loading, management, and execution of
extensions. To access the page's DOM, the extension injects and executes
\emph{content scripts} in the page's context which are regular JavaScript
programs.
