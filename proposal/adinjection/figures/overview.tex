        \textbf{(1)}~The user accesses the publisher's site.
        \textbf{(2)}~An ad-injecting browser extension adds DOM elements to display ads to the user, and optionally removes existing ads.
        \textbf{(3)}~Ad revenue is diverted from the publisher.
        \textbf{(4)}~Ad impressions, clicks, and conversions are instead directed to the extension's ad network.
        \textbf{(5)}~Ad revenue flows to the extension author.
