## Make Linux Submodule
```
make modules SUBDIRS=drivers/...
```
or
```
make M=./drivers/staging/comedi/
```
## remove link generated by update-alternatives
`sudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc`

##sudo and keep the environment variables
`sudo` seems can change the environment variables,
use `sudo -E` to keep these environment variables

## expose local port to the intenet
Local heavy task like tensorflow/syzkaller, usually use local web service to report progress, CLI tool like links/lynx functionality is very limited(a little fancy display will result in failure), thus we can either expose certain port to the public(`localchannel` is a very good tool in this regard), also, VNC can be used.
