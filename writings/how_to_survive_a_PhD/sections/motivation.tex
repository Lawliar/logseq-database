%% write more
Out of the a few advices that I found helpful from my advisor, "write more, even if it's not your paper, write something everyday." 
is the one that I've always wanted to try, but could not due to the emptyness in my head. 
Now since I've came to a milestone where I've finished my first project, it's a good opportunity to connect the dots that I've found for the past year(and 3 months).

I inteded this to be something to update from time to time, just like a paper that needs to be polished again and again.
