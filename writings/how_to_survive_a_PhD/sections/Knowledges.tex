\section{What's magic and what's not}
For most, even for the CS-backgrouned students, a balance between being ama(u)zed by the "magic" of computers and figuring out everything behind the magic 
has accompanied the learning process especially in the beginning period.
We always love the "magic", the magic can be "download CodeBlocks, create a C file as instructed, and write Hello world, and press "compile and run"", and boom, you make it!
There is no denying the fact that, the magic is why computers are so facinating to the public, the pioneers tried very hard to abstract things to make computers comprehensible
for laymans. What make matters worse(better), the magic are all around the learning process, the existance of magic seems norm for many fields.

I'm not sure for other computer fields, for a research field as messy as system security, I struggled a lot to figure out what should I take as magic, and what should not.
