### What are the differences between these analysis? And what's their relations with the DDG/CDG/PDG?
- Data-flow analysis
- Taint alaysis
## What precisely does "a value is tainted" in taint analysis mean?
It looks to me, "a value  is tainted" can be of various importance depending on how it's calculated, how it's tainted.
## Why "movw", means move 2 bytes, and the "w", a word doesn't mean 4 bytes, given in 32-bit like x86,  a word is 4 bytes?

## How the gdb inject "int 0x03" in the binary, wouldn't this affect the program layout(messing up the addressing of other instructions)?
