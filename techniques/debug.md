- if a call instruction failed and cause a hard fault, especially it's in assembly, e.g., "blx r1", in order to figure out what went wrong, you have to make sure you stepped into the function. I thought when I single step, it should always go into the function, but for this "blx r1" for example, it is not the case, the execution just went on inside the function, and this function went wrong somewhere which I don't know. For this case, make sure you are single-stepping in instruction mode, if you are not in instruction mode, the execution of the function can be skipped.
