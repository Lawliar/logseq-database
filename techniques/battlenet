## battlenet keeps connecting to a cn server which did not respond, and the progress is stucked at 45%
I was trying to install heartstone, I acidentally choose Chinese when I first decided to install.
Then, I looked at the Update Agent log (which is weirdly located under Users/shared/Battle.net), it keeps connecting to a "cn.update" server which did not respond. 
I looked at many different blog post, saying that, this is because I choosed Chinese as language, so it affects the server that it tries to download from chinese server, which cannot work.
I tried to look for the configuration files which specify this, but I looked everywhere cannot find it.
And I keep deleting this Agent app, and reinstall, the configuration did not change (and it didn't prompt me with the choice to choose language)

Then, according to some blog saying that, you should create a English account (I figured, because I used my Apple ID with my Chinese name).
So, I created another Mac User, and try to download Battlenet (choosing English this time).
And it worked. 

So I switched back to my main account, it somehow also worked. 
(I guess this is because this configuration file is somewhere in the shared folder?)
