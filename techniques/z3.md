## z3 cmake_dir
when some cmake project is built on z3, and your z3 is built from source.
When you write the cmake file for such a project, and it asks you to pass in the z3-cmake dir.
It's kinda confusing, because, under the build dir of z3, there is a cmake, folder, which you normally assume it is the dir,
but it's not, it's just the build dir itself.
This is kinda different from any other project.
