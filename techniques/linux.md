## remove link generated by update-alternatives
`sudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc`

## useful commands
1. mtr : more informative ping
2. bpytop: fancy top
3. 

##sudo and keep the environment variables
`sudo` seems can change the environment variables,
use `sudo -E` to keep these environment variables

## expose local port to the intenet
Local heavy task like tensorflow/syzkaller, usually use local web service to report progress, CLI tool like links/lynx functionality is very limited(a little fancy display will result in failure), thus we can either expose certain port to the public(`localchannel` is a very good tool in this regard), also, VNC can be used.

## sort htop as the process hierachy
F5

## check out port status
netstat -tulpn | grep 56741
note that, if this port is occupied by a root process, and you're normal user, the program name won't be displayed, use sudo to show the program name.

## check out the directory size
du -h -d 1

## ssh set-up
after key gen, you have `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, former, your private key, is passphrase protected, the latter, you pub key, is your public identity.
### remote setting
copy `id_rsa.pub` to your remote server which you use your pub key as a login authentication method, and append it into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, 
then the remote server can recognize you as an authenticated party.
### local setting
place your two key files into ~/.ssh/
add 
`eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add
`
to your .bashrc, then ssh-agent will remember the passphrase you use (to protect the private key), so, you don't have to input the passphrase everytime you use your private key.

now, you should be able to just ssh remote\_user@server to login to your server.

## shared memory

1. key_id = ftok(...)
2. block_id = shmget(key_id...)
3. ptr = shmat(block_id), shmdt(ptr)

without 1, you can also specify key_id to IPC_PRIVATE

## /etc/fstab
https://wiki.debian.org/fstab
sth like this if you wanto to mount a folder shared in windows to linux
`
//10.110.150.217/Users/lcm/Documents/GitHub /home/lcm/win-github cifs username=lcm,noauto,sync,rw,users 0 0
`
### in /etc/fstab
although you can use the device psedo file, (e.g., `/dev/sda`) to specify the device that you want to mount, it is recommended, however to use the UUID, since the device name is dynamnic and can be different from boot to boot. 
as to how to use UUID, refer to here, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingUUID, as well aw the fstab page above

## failed to create symbolic link: operation not supported on socket
most likely it's because you're making a shared library in a shared folder, making shared library is not supported, somehow? Just move to a local folder, because creating a sym link to a shared file(not physically located in the file system) does not make too much sense.

## install 32-bit library on 64 bit OS
### When you try to build a 32-bit lib/exe on a 64-bit OS, if you have to install all kinds of 32-bit dependent libraries/packages(binutil:i386), and it starts messing with the 64-bit libraries, you should seriously consider if you should just use a 32-bit docker image
https://askubuntu.com/questions/1304803/ubuntu-20-04-install-both-32-bit-and-64-bit-libraries
check out the foreign arch and add that e.g. apt install z3:i386
### if the docker doesn't have 32bit image(say for example, not ubuntu-20.04 still don't have 386 support)chroot is the best option
follow these two links
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BasicChroot
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2012/03/build-32-bit-r-on-64-bit-ubuntu-by-utilizing-chroot/
`sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch i386 Focal /home/lcm/github/symcc/chroot http://mirror.enzu.com/ubuntu/`


## check where the apt package is installed
dpkg -L libz3-dev:i386

## if a shared library is missing: maybe you need to clean the cache

## how to make ubuntu terminal history output go away:
`clean` and `reset` only clean up but you can still scroll up to see the history printing,
this can cause trouble especially when you are fixing many program errors one by one, you fix one and you wanna quickly locate the next one.

with `clear && printf '\e[3J'` the history seems disappear which is pretty amazing

## mount nfs(hosted in a ubuntu machine) from WSL or MacOS

## wake-on-lan wol
1. turn on the bios setting (if there is any). According to my experience, if there is not, then it is enabled by default, I guess?
2. enable it either through nmcli or ethtool. I tried to use the systemd service to automatically, but it seems not working, so I use:
`
wakeon_state=$(nmcli c show netplan-enp2s0 | grep wake-on-lan: | awk '{print $2}')
if [[ "$workon_state" == "--" ]]; then
        sudo nmcli c modify netplan-enp2s0  802-3-ethernet.wake-on-lan magic
        echo "set wol"
else
        echo "wol is set"
fi
`
3. use wakeonlan, however, specify both the static IP also the MAC. If you just specify the MAC, the packet won't be delivered somehow, according to this post:https://necromuralist.github.io/posts/enabling-wake-on-lan/

4. Even with this successful setting, I am not able to wake the computer from shutting down, rather only from suspension.


## how to diff two command line outputs
https://askubuntu.com/a/229450/803553
### take-away
1. `` substitutes commandline output to new commandline
2. () is process substitution, it allows process input/output to be referred to using a filename. 


### linux as storage server
- since I somehow have the set up of a linux machine with 4T SSD + 14 T Hard drive, and a windows machine with 512G SSD and A GPU.
- It is natural to mount the storage to windows and MacOS.
- Although I initially want to use nfs to rule it all, it works on MacOS-Linux, without issue, however, I saw here that NFS is not great on mounting to windows
https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/ji6uil/mount_nfs_on_windows/
- So, I use Samba for the same storage following here https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-samba#3-setting-up-samba

### resize partition and subsequently, the fs w/ losing data.
this usually happens in VM, as, in physical machine, you need to replace the physical median, which involves copy the data already, whereas in VM, if you run out of disk space, you can expand the physical capacity of the disk, then you need to resize the file system to fit the new size. 
although this can be easily achieved through chatgpt, but it is still interesting to learn that, you first resize the partition, then you resize the fs.
the first part is usually done through `fdisk`
the latter is done through `resize2fs` for ext4

### find duplicate files:
find . ! -empty -type f -exec md5sum {} + | sort | uniq -w32 -dD
