## Make Linux Submodule
```
make modules SUBDIRS=drivers/...
```
or
```
make M=./drivers/staging/comedi/
```

## remove link generated by update-alternatives
`sudo update-alternatives --remove-all gcc`

##sudo and keep the environment variables
`sudo` seems can change the environment variables,
use `sudo -E` to keep these environment variables

## expose local port to the intenet
Local heavy task like tensorflow/syzkaller, usually use local web service to report progress, CLI tool like links/lynx functionality is very limited(a little fancy display will result in failure), thus we can either expose certain port to the public(`localchannel` is a very good tool in this regard), also, VNC can be used.

## sort htop as the process hierachy
F5

## check out port status
netstat -tulpn | grep 56741
note that, if this port is occupied by a root process, and you're normal user, the program name won't be displayed, use sudo to show the program name.

## check out the directory size
du -h -d 1

## ssh set-up
after key gen, you have `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, former, your private key, is passphrase protected, the latter, you pub key, is your public identity.
### remote setting
copy `id_rsa.pub` to your remote server which you use your pub key as a login authentication method, and append it into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, 
then the remote server can recognize you as an authenticated party.
### local setting
place your two key files into ~/.ssh/
add 
`eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add
`
to your .bashrc, then ssh-agent will remember the passphrase you use (to protect the private key), so, you don't have to input the passphrase everytime you use your private key.

now, you should be able to just ssh remote\_user@server to login to your server.
